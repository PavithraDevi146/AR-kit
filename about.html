    <h2><b>ABOUT AUGMENTED REALITY</b></h2>
    <p>Augmented reality (AR) is an enhanced version of the real world, achieved through the use of computer-generated digital information. AR uses computer hardware and software, such as apps, consoles, screens, or projections, to combine digital information with the real-world environment.Some early adopters in the retail sector have developed AR technologies designed to enhance the consumer shopping experience. Augmented reality has been incorporated into store catalog apps, which allows consumers to visualize what different products would look like in different environments</p>
